The problem with express was , token based authentication. Loop back gave it straight out of the box.

#Install Loopback Cli
```
sudo npm isntall -g loopback-cli
```
That will give us access to create models and etc.

###To start a new application:
```
lb
```
###To start the application :
```
cd folder_name/
node .
```
Inside server/datasource.json

the default datasource is memory.
But, you can have other datasources like mongo.

Inside /boot
there is authentication.js. If you want to authenticate you have to do it here.

Server.enableAuth();

#Settig up the mongo connecter.
```
npm isntall –save loopback-connector-mongodb
```
* Create a new Data source

* lb datasource mongoDS --connector mongoDB

* Inside datasources.json there was db and that replaces the ones in model-config.json

* make sure to rename the MongoDS in datasource.json to db

###To create a model 
```
lb model
```
* you will find the created model in commons folder.
* You can manually edit the models using model_name.json.



###Authenticate
```
lb acl
```
* set up your requirements.

* In /User/login you can pass the credentials and set the id as token.

* It will let you access authenticated features.

* You can also control a specific kind of authentication(Read/Write etc).

* To remove an authentication manually you can remove it from model’s .json file inside acl[] array
